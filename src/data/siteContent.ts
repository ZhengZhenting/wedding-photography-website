    headline: "Every love story deserves to be remembered beautifully",
    intro:
      "My photography is rooted in a clean, architectural eye — I find beauty in light, composition, and the quiet moments that tell a deeper story. Every frame is intentional, blending documentary honesty with a fine-art sensibility to create images that are timeless and elegant.",
    philosophy:
      "Before picking up a camera professionally, I trained as an architect for over ten years — shaping my eye for structure, proportion, and beauty in every detail. Photography has been a lifelong passion, and for the past five years I've worked as a freelance photographer across hundreds of weddings, events, and fashion shoots. I work in both digital and analogue formats, so if you have a love for film photography, I'd be happy to accommodate.",
